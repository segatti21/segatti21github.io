Description of the project with a blurb about print-in-place parts. Perform external
research to determine other applications print-in-place has been used. What
combination of materials work well for print-in-place?

## CAD Model
### Plier Handles and Clamps:

o Print settings
o Picture gallery of iterations and pliers.
o .GIF of pliers working 

## Design and Iterative Process: (e.g., how was the spring component created and how is it retained in the model, materials used)

## Relevant Plier Specifications:
o Relevant specifications of the pliers (jaw length, jaw capacity)

## Pliers in Action!

Here you can see the pliers picking up resistors and moving them in real time.
When an unskilled, unpracticed user (me) could use the pliers to move 14 resistors in 30 seconds.
