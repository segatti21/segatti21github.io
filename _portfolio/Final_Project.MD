### After choosing the third path, Digital Fabricatiin Aid, of the Generative Design Final Project for CHBE 4200, the idea of a new solder iron holder that can [hold the iron](#hold), [hold new soldering tips](#tips), and [hold solder cleaning wire](#wire) came to mind.

## Overview of the Part and Application

### Final Part Description and Real World Context

#### This Part Can...

##### - Hold the Soldering Iron

##### - Hold BLANK >= Six Soldering Tips

##### - Hold BLANK mm^2 of Soldering Iron Tip Cleaner Wire

#### ... Which is Important in the Real World Because...



### How This Improves the Functionality of the Soldering Station

By having the tip and cleaning wire both so readily available and nearby the iron itself, this allows for quicker soldering times. These assisting items needed at the station will have high proximity to the area of use, meaning less time spent on transportation and search. Also, this leads to higher area organization. When placing something back into its position after using it with the iron, the easiest spot to put it is also where it goes.

## Preserve and Obstacle Geometry


### Critial Preserve Regions
Quick writeup: What were the critical preserve regions in your model (e.g., mounting points, tool interfaces, constrained paths)?

| Component Name | Preserve Rational | Picture in CAD |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Base of Holder | | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/segatti21/segatti21github.io/main/assets/img/fp/BLANK" alt="Next Comp" style="width:60%; max-width:500px;" /> |

## Critical Obstacle Regions

Quick writeup: How did you define obstacle geometry (i.e., space the part must avoid)?

| Component Name | Obstacle  Rational | Picture in CAD |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Solder Tip Air | The tip of the soldering iron must be free of obstacles | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/segatti21/segatti21github.io/main/assets/img/fp/BLANK.png" alt="Tip Air Component" style="width:60%; max-width:500px;" />|
