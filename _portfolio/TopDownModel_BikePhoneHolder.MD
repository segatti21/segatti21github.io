Writeup including (>500 words):
▪ A description of top-down modeling and how it was leveraged in this assignment.
▪ Rationale behind your design

• Did you have to change any dimensions to account for the 3D
printing process?
• What type of 3D printing did you use? Why?
▪ Brief Assembly/use instructions
▪ Which printing technology and why did you use for each part?
